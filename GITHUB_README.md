# Multi-Scale Quantum Error Correction Cosmology (MSQECC)

**Status:** Theoretical framework in development (archived February 2026)

**Author:** Jack Blessed Kimani 

---

## What This Is

A conceptual framework extending quantum error correction principles from AdS/CFT correspondence to general cosmological settings, proposing that dark matter, dark energy, fine structure constant, and baryon asymmetry may emerge from information-theoretic principles.

**This is not a complete, peer-reviewed physics paper.** This is an archived theoretical framework documenting synthetic thinking across quantum information theory, cosmology, and quantum foundations as of February 2026.

---

## Current Limitations

This framework contains several open problems and conjectures that require substantial mathematical development:

- **Master Equation (Eq. 6):** Requires rigorous existence/uniqueness proof
- **Distance metric d_QECC (Eq. 7):** Requires careful continuum limit construction  
- **Dark matter prediction (Eq. 9):** Requires explicit worked calculations
- **Dark energy prediction (Eq. 10):** Requires dimensional analysis and spatial dependence derivation
- **Born rule emergence (Eq. 12):** Requires measure-theoretic construction
- **Constants from self-consistency (Sec 6.6):** Requires explicit equations

See the preface in the manuscript for detailed discussion of limitations.

## Why Posted Here

This work is shared publicly as:

1. **Portfolio piece** demonstrating synthetic thinking across multiple domains
2. **Conceptual roadmap** for future rigorous development with institutional collaboration
3. **Open documentation** of theoretical exploration before pursuing practical work in healthcare informatics

## Future Development

Planned development timeline:

- **2026-2028:** Author pursuing clinical informatics work in Germany
- **2028+:** Return to this framework with institutional affiliation, mathematical physics collaboration, and experimental validation program
- **Target:** Peer-reviewed publication with worked calculations and testable predictions

---

## What This Is Not

This is **not**:
- A claim of priority or completeness
- Ready for peer review or citation
- A finished scientific result
- Experimental physics (no data, no validation)

This **is**:
- A documented theoretical exploration
- A synthesis of existing ideas in a novel framework
- A personal research archive
- An invitation for future collaboration when author has institutional backing

## Technical Notes

- **Mathematical rigor:** Several derivations require completion (see preface)
- **Experimental validation:** All predictions require explicit protocols and error analysis
- **Peer review:** Not yet submitted to any journal; archived for future submission with affiliation
